## System description

### Function

In this project, I am going to design a system to implement the following functions: read picture from the environment, and display the image captured from the camera in real time. 

### Specification

The resolution and frame rate of the system are set to be 640x480 and 60 fps respectively.

### Extension

If time permits, I am planning to attach additional functions to the system. For example, digit and letter recognition.

## Pmods devices

### ov5640




### VGA screen



 Describe the operation principle of the pmod device/external device, the
protocol used, if any, and the required sequence of signals to drive the pmod.
 Describe the design of the pmod drive and another key module, including the
algorithm, ASM chart, conceptual diagram, and VHDL code.


## development environment


## global inputs and outputs


## Top module block diagrams. Explain the function of each module, and define
the input and output signals for each module.


## Task plan, schedule, and budget




 Test results, analysis of performances, meeting of specifications and
limitations of the system.
